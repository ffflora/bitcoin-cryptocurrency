### Hash Function

Hash property:

1. Collision-free: can't find `x != y` st `H(x) = H(y)` (hard to find collision)

   Application: Hash as message digest:

   - to recognize a file efficiently that we saw before, just remember its hash.

2. Hiding: Given H(x), it is infeasible to find x.

   attention: No value of x are likely. X needed to be chosen from the sets that are very spread out.

   Application: want to 'seal the value in a envelope' and 'open th envelope later'.

   - commit to a value, reveal it later.

3. Puzzle-friendly:  for every possible output value y, if k is chosen from a distribution with high min-entropy, then it is infeasible to find `x` s.t.`H(k|x) = y

   Application:  search puzzle:

   - given a puzzle-ID and a target set Y, try to find a solution x s.t. `H(id|x) belongs to Y`

**SHA256-HASH**: no collision has ever been found.

### Hash pointers and data structures

Linked List

Binary Tree

### Digital Signatures

```
(sk,pk):= generateKeys(keysize)
	sk: secrest signing key
	pk: public verification key
sig:= sign(sk,message)

isValid := verify(pk,message,sig)
```

- algorithms are randomized, but need good source of randomness

- limit on message size

  - fix: use hash(mssage) rather than message

  

### Public Keys as identities
